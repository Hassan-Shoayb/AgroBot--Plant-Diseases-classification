Using Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to detect plant disease from the snapshot of the plant leaf. All a farmer has to do is capture the plant leaf image from the app on his mobile. The app will send this image to a TensorFlow tflite model. The AI model will detect the disease from the image and send back the disease name, remedies, and precautions to the farmer.
